The `<Camera>` component already provides a natively implemented zoom gesture which you can enable with the [`enableZoomGesture`](/docs/api/interfaces/cameraprops.cameraprops-1#enablezoomgesture) prop. This does not require any additional work, but if you want to setup a custom gesture, such as the one in Snapchat or Instagram where you move up your finger while recording, continue reading.

### Animation libraries

While you can use any animation library to animate the `zoom` property (or use no animation library at all) it is recommended to use [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) (v2) to achieve best performance. Head over to their [Installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/installation) to install Reanimated if you haven't already.

### Implementation

The following example implements a button which smoothly zooms to a random value using [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated):

```tsx
import Reanimated, {
  useAnimatedProps,
  useSharedValue,
  withSpring,
} from "react-native-reanimated"

const ReanimatedCamera = Reanimated.createAnimatedComponent(Camera)
Reanimated.addWhitelistedNativeProps({
  zoom: true,
})

export function App() {
  const devices = useCameraDevices()
  const device = devices.back
  const zoom = useSharedValue(0)

  const onRandomZoomPress = useCallback(() => {
    zoom.value = withSpring(Math.random())
  }, [])

  const animatedProps = useAnimatedProps<Partial<CameraProps>>(
    () => ({ zoom: zoom.value }),
    [zoom]
  )

  if (device == null) return <LoadingView />
  return (
    <>
      <ReanimatedCamera
        style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
        device={device}
        isActive={true}
        animatedProps={animatedProps}
      />
      <TouchableOpacity
        style={styles.zoomButton}
        onPress={onRandomZoomPress}>
        <Text>Zoom randomly!</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Explanation

1. The `Camera` was made animatable using `Reanimated.createAnimatedComponent`
2. The `zoom` property is added to the whitelisted native props to make it animatable.
    > Note that this might not be needed in the future, see: [reanimated#1409](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pull/1409)
3. Using [`useSharedValue`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/useSharedValue), we're creating a shared value that holds the value for the `zoom` property.
4. Using the [`useAnimatedProps`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/useAnimatedProps) hook, we apply the shared value to Camera's `zoom` property.
5. We apply the animated props to the `ReanimatedCamera` component's `animatedProps` property.

### Logarithmic scale

A Camera's `zoom` property is represented in a **logarithmic scale**. That means, increasing from `0` to `0.1` will appear to be a much larger offset than increasing from `0.9` to `1`. If you want to implement a zoom gesture (`<PinchGestureHandler>`, `<PanGestureHandler>`), try to flatten the `zoom` property to a **linear scale** by raising it **exponentially**. (`zoom.value ** 2`)

### Pinch-to-zoom

The above example only demonstrates how to animate the `zoom` property. To actually implement pinch-to-zoom or pan-to-zoom, take a look at the [VisionCamera example app](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera/tree/main/example), the pinch-to-zoom gesture can be found [here](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera/blob/d8551792e97eaa6fa768f54059ffce054bf748d9/example/src/CameraPage.tsx#L162-L176), and the pan-to-zoom gesture can be found [here](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera/blob/d8551792e97eaa6fa768f54059ffce054bf748d9/example/src/views/CaptureButton.tsx#L185-L205). They implement a real world use-case, where the maximum zoom value is clamped to a realistic value, and the zoom responds very gracefully by using a logarithmic scale.
