## Interacting with Frame Processors

### Access JS values

Since Frame Processors run in [Worklets](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-worklets-core/blob/main/docs/WORKLETS.md), you can directly use JS values such as React state which are readonly-copied into the Frame Processor:

```tsx
// User can look for specific objects
const targetObject = 'banana'

const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const objects = detectObjects(frame)
  const bananas = objects.filter((o) => o.type === targetObject)
  console.log(`Detected ${bananas} bananas!`)
}, [targetObject])
```

### Shared Values

You can also easily read from, and assign to [Shared Values](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-worklets-core/blob/main/docs/WORKLETS.md#shared-values), which can be written to from inside a Frame Processor and read from any other context (either React JS, Skia, or Reanimated):

```tsx
const bananas = useSharedValue([])

// Detect Bananas in Frame Processor
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const objects = detectObjects(frame)
  bananas.value = objects.filter((o) => o.type === 'banana')
}, [bananas])

// Draw bananas in a Skia Canvas
const onDraw = useDrawCallback((canvas) => {
  for (const banana of bananas.value) {
    const rect = Skia.XYWHRect(banana.x,
                               banana.y,
                               banana.width,
                               banana.height)
    const paint = Skia.Paint()
    paint.setColor(Skia.Color('red'))
    frame.drawRect(rect, paint)
  }
})
```

### Call functions

And you can also call back to the React-JS thread by using `createRunOnJS(...)`:

```tsx
const onFaceDetected = Worklets.createRunOnJS((face: Face) => {
  navigation.push("FiltersPage", { face: face })
})

const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const faces = scanFaces(frame)
  if (faces.length > 0) {
    onFaceDetected(faces[0])
  }
}, [onFaceDetected])
```

## Scheduling

By default, Frame Processors run synchronously in the Camera pipeline. A Frame Processor has to finish executing before the next Frame arrives, otherwise the new Frame will be dropped.
For example, if your Camera is running at **30 FPS**, your Frame Processor has **33ms** to finish executing before the next Frame arrives. At **60 FPS**, you only have **16ms**.

### Running asynchronously

For longer running processing, you can use [`runAsync(..)`](/docs/api/#runasync) to run code asynchronously on a different Thread.
Only one `runAsync(..)` call will execute at the same time, so `runAsync(..)` is **not parallel**, **but asynchronous**.

For example, if your Camera is running at 60 FPS (16ms per frame), and a heavy ML face detection Frame Processor Plugin takes 500ms to execute, you can call the plugin inside `runAsync(..)` to allow the Camera to still run at 60 FPS, but offload the heavy ML face detection plugin to the asynchronous context, where it will run at 2 FPS.

```ts
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  console.log("I'm running synchronously at 60 FPS!")

  runAsync(frame, () => {
    'worklet'
    console.log("I'm running asynchronously, possibly at a lower FPS rate!")
    const faces = detectFaces(frame)
  })
}, [])
```

### Running at a throttled FPS rate

Some Frame Processor Plugins don't need to run on every Frame, for example a Frame Processor that detects the brightness in a Frame only needs to run twice per second. You can achieve this by using [`runAtTargetFps(..)`](/docs/api/#runattargetfps), which still runs on the main Frame Processor Thread but drops all Frames that come in faster than the specified target FPS rate:

```ts
const TARGET_FPS = 2
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  console.log("I'm running synchronously at 60 FPS!")

  runAtTargetFps(TARGET_FPS, () => {
    'worklet'
    console.log("I'm running synchronously at 2 FPS!")
    const brightness = detectBrightness(frame)
  })
}, [])
```
