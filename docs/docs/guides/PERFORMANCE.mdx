## Performance of VisionCamera

VisionCamera is highly optimized to be **as fast as a native Camera app**, and is sometimes even faster than that.
I am using highly efficient native GPU buffer formats (such as YUV 4:2:0, or lossy compressed YUV 4:2:0), running the video pipelines in parallel, using C++ for the Frame Processors implementation, and other tricks to make sure VisionCamera is as efficient as possible.

## Making it faster

There are a few things you can do to make your Camera faster which requires a core understanding of how Cameras work under the hood:

### Simpler Camera Device

Selecting a "simpler" Camera Device (i.e. a Camera Device with _less physical cameras_) allows the Camera to initialize faster as it does not have to start multiple devices at once.
You can prefer a simple wide-angle Camera (`['wide-angle-camera']`) over a triple camera (`['ultra-wide-angle-camera', 'wide-angle-camera', 'telephoto-camera']`) to significantly speed up initialization time.

<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const fasterDevice = useCameraDevice('back', {
  physicalDevices: ['wide-angle-camera']
})
const slowerDevice = useCameraDevice('back', {
  physicalDevices: ['ultra-wide-angle-camera', 'wide-angle-camera', 'telephoto-camera']
})
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const devices = Camera.getAvailableCameraDevices()
const fasterDevice = getCameraDevice(devices, 'back', {
  physicalDevices: ['wide-angle-camera']
})
const slowerDevice = getCameraDevice(devices, 'back', {
  physicalDevices: ['ultra-wide-angle-camera', 'wide-angle-camera', 'telephoto-camera']
})
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

See ["Camera Devices"](devices) for more information.

Note: By default (when not passing the options object), a simpler device is already chosen.

### No Video HDR

Video HDR uses 10-bit formats and/or additional processing steps that come with additional computation overhead. Disable [`videoHdr`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#videohdr) for higher efficiency.

### Buffer Compression

Enable Buffer Compression ([`enableBufferCompression`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#enablebuffercompression)) to use lossy-compressed buffers for the Camera's video pipeline. These buffers can use less memory and are more efficient.

Note: When not using a `frameProcessor`, buffer compression is automatically enabled.

### Video Stabilization

Video Stabilization requires additional overhead to start the algorithm, so disabling [`videoStabilizationMode`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#videostabilizationmode) can significantly speed up the Camera initialization time.

### Pixel Format

The Camera's native [`PixelFormat`](/docs/api#pixelformat) is `yuv`. If you set <code>[pixelFormat](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#pixelformat)="rgb"</code>, the pipeline will need to convert the `yuv` buffers to `rgb`, which introduces additional overhead and consumes more memory.

If you are using any Frame Processor Plugins that work with `rgb`, try to replace them with `yuv`-based plugins instead and set your `pixelFormat` to `yuv`.

### Disable unneeded pipelines

Only enable [`photo`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#photo), [`video`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#video), [`codeScanner`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#codescanner) or [`frameProcessor`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#frameprocessor) if needed.

### No Skia Frame Processor

If you are not using Skia, use `useFrameProcessor` instead of `useSkiaFrameProcessor`, as `useFrameProcessor` is more lightweight.

### Using `isActive`

The [`isActive`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#isactive) prop controls whether the Camera should actively stream frames. Instead of fully unmounting the `<Camera>` component and remounting it again, keep it mounted and just switch `isActive` on or off. This makes the Camera resume much faster as it internally keeps the session warmed up.

### Fast Photos

If you need to take photos as fast as possible, use a [`qualityBalance`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#qualitybalance) of `'speed'` to speed up the photo pipeline:

```jsx
return <Camera {...props} qualityBalance="speed" />
```

### Snapshot Capture

If photo capture is still too slow for your use-case, consider [taking snapshots](/docs/guides/taking-photos#taking-snapshots) instead:

```ts
const snapshot = await camera.current.takeSnapshot({
  quality: 85
})
```

### Appropriate Format resolution

Choose formats efficiently. If your backend can only handle 1080p videos, don't select a 4k format if you have to downsize it later anyways - instead use 1080p already for the Camera:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const format = useCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } }
])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const format = getCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: { width: 1920, height: 1080 } }
])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Appropriate Format FPS

Same as with format resolutions, also record at the frame rate you expect. Setting your frame rate higher can use more memory and heat up the battery.
If your backend can only handle 30 FPS, there is no need to record at 60 FPS, instead set the Camera' [`fps`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#fps) to 30:

```jsx
return <Camera {...props} fps={30} />
```
