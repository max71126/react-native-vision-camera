Before opening an issue, make sure you try the following:

## iOS

1. Try cleaning and rebuilding **everything**:
   ```sh
   rm -rf package-lock.json && rm -rf yarn.lock && rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf ios/Podfile.lock && rm -rf ios/Pods
   npm i  # or "yarn"
   cd ios && pod repo update && pod update && pod install
   ```
2. Check your minimum iOS version. VisionCamera requires a minimum iOS version of **11.0**.
   1. Open your `Podfile`
   2. Make sure `platform :ios` is set to `11.0` or higher
   3. Make sure `iOS Deployment Target` is set to `11.0` or higher (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in `project.pbxproj`)
3. Check your Swift version. VisionCamera requires a minimum Swift version of **5.2**.
   1. Open `project.pbxproj` in a Text Editor
   2. If the `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATH` value is set, make sure there is no explicit reference to Swift-5.0. If there is, remove it. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66281846/1123156).
   3. If the `SWIFT_VERSION` value is set, make sure it is set to `5.2` or higher.
4. Make sure you have created a Swift bridging header in your project.
   1. Open your project (`.xcworkspace`) in Xcode
   2. Press **File** > **New** > **File** (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>)
   3. Select **Swift File** and press **Next**
   4. Choose whatever name you want, e.g. `File.swift` and press **Create**
   5. Press **Create Bridging Header** when promted.
5. If you're having runtime issues, check the logs in Xcode to find out more. In Xcode, go to **View** > **Debug Area** > **Activate Console**  (<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>).
   * For errors without messages, there's often an error code attached. Look up the error code on [osstatus.com](https://www.osstatus.com) to get more information about a specific error.
6. If your Frame Processor is not running, make sure you check the native Xcode logs to find out why. Also make sure you are not using a remote JS debugger such as Google Chrome, since those don't work with JSI.

## Android

1. Try cleaning and rebuilding **everything**:
   ```sh
   ./android/gradlew clean
   rm -rf package-lock.json && rm -rf yarn.lock && rm -rf node_modules
   npm i  # or "yarn"
   ```
2. Since the Android implementation uses the not-yet fully stable **CameraX** API, make sure you've browsed the [CameraX issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues?q=componentid:618491%20status:open) to find out if your issue is a limitation by the **CameraX** library even I cannot get around.
3. Make sure you have installed the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk).
4. Make sure your minimum SDK version is **21 or higher**, and target SDK version is **31 or higher**. See [the example's `build.gradle`](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/blob/main/example/android/build.gradle#L5-L10) for reference.
   1. Open your `build.gradle`
   2. Set `buildToolsVersion` to `30.0.0` or higher
   3. Set `compileSdkVersion` to `31` or higher
   4. Set `targetSdkVersion` to `31` or higher
   5. Set `minSdkVersion` to `21` or higher
   6. Set `ndkVersion` to `"20.1.5948944"` or higher
   7. Update the Gradle Build-Tools version to `4.1.2` or higher:
      ```
      classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.2")
      ```
4. Make sure your Gradle Wrapper version is `6.5` or higher. In `gradle-wrapper.properties`, set:
   ```
   distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.5-all.zip
   ```
5. If you're having runtime issues, check the logs in Android Studio/Logcat to find out more. In Android Studio, go to **View** > **Tool Windows** > **Logcat** (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd>) or run `adb logcat` in Terminal.
6. If a camera device is not being returned by [`Camera.getAvailableCameraDevices()`](/docs/api/classes/Camera#getavailablecameradevices), make sure it is a Camera2 compatible device. See [this section in the Android docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraDevice#reprocessing) for more information.
7. If your Frame Processor is not running, make sure you check the native Android Studio/Logcat logs to find out why. Also make sure you are not using a remote JS debugger such as Google Chrome, since those don't work with JSI.
