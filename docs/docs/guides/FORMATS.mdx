## What are camera formats?

Each camera device (see ["Camera Devices"](devices)) provides a number of formats that have different specifications.
There are formats specifically designed for high-resolution photo capture (but lower FPS), or formats that are designed for slow-motion video capture which have frame-rates of up to 240 FPS (but lower resolution).

## What if I don't want to choose a format?

If you don't want to specify a Camera Format, you don't have to. The Camera automatically chooses the best matching format for the current camera device. This is why the Camera's `format` property is _optional_.

## Choosing custom formats

To understand a bit more about camera formats, you first need to understand a few "general camera basics":

* Each camera device is built differently, e.g. front-facing Cameras often don't have resolutions as high as the Cameras on the back. (see ["Camera Devices"](devices))
* Formats are designed for specific use-cases, here are some examples for formats on a Camera Device:
  * 4k Photos, 4k Videos, 30 FPS (high quality)
  * 4k Photos, 1080p Videos, 60 FPS (high FPS)
  * 4k Photos, 1080p Videos, 240 FPS (ultra high FPS/slow motion)
  * 720p Photos, 720p Videos, 30 FPS (smaller buffers/e.g. faster face detection)
* Each app has different requirements, so the format filtering is up to you.

To get all available formats, simply use the `CameraDevice`'s [`formats` property](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice#formats).  These are a [CameraFormat's](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat) props:

- [`photoHeight`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#photoheight)/[`photoWidth`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#photoWidth): The resolution that will be used for taking photos. Choose a format with your desired resolution.
- [`videoHeight`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#videoheight)/[`videoWidth`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#videoWidth): The resolution that will be used for recording videos. Choose a format with your desired resolution.
- [`minFps`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#minfps)/[`maxFps`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#maxfps): A range of possible values for the `fps` property. For example, if your format has `minFps: 1` and `maxFps: 60`, you can either use `fps={30}`, `fps={60}` or any other value in between for recording videos.
- [`videoStabilizationModes`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#videostabilizationmodes): All supported Video Stabilization Modes, digital and optical. If this specific format contains your desired [`VideoStabilizationMode`](/docs/api/#videostabilizationmode), you can pass it to your `<Camera>` via the [`videoStabilizationMode` property](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#videoStabilizationMode).
- [`pixelFormats`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#pixelformats): All supported Pixel Formats. If this specific format contains your desired [`PixelFormat`](/docs/api/#PixelFormat), you can pass it to your `<Camera>` via the [`pixelFormat` property](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#pixelFormat).
- [`supportsVideoHDR`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#supportsvideohdr): Whether this specific format supports true 10-bit HDR for video capture. If this is `true`, you can enable `hdr` on your `<Camera>`.
- [`supportsPhotoHDR`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#supportsphotohdr): Whether this specific format supports HDR for photo capture. It will use multiple captures to fuse over-exposed and under-exposed Images together to form one HDR photo. If this is `true`, you can enable `hdr` on your `<Camera>`.
- [`supportsDepthCapture`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#supportsdepthcapture): Whether this specific format supports depth data capture. For devices like the TrueDepth/LiDAR cameras, this will always be true.
- ...and more. See the [`CameraDeviceFormat` type](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat) for all supported properties.

You can either find a matching format manually by looping through your `CameraDevice`'s [`formats` property](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice#formats), or by using the helper functions from VisionCamera:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const device = ...
const format = useCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: { width: 3048, height: 2160 } },
  { fps: 60 }
])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const device = ...
const format = getCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: { width: 3048, height: 2160 } },
  { fps: 60 }
])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The **filter is ordered by priority (descending)**, so if there is no format that supports both 4k and 60 FPS, the function will prefer 4k@30FPS formats over 1080p@60FPS formats, because 4k is a more important requirement than 60 FPS.

If you want to record slow-motion videos, you want a format with a really high FPS setting, for example:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const device = ...
const format = useCameraFormat(device, [
  { fps: 240 }
])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const device = ...
const format = getCameraFormat(device, [
  { fps: 240 }
])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If there is no format that has exactly 240 FPS, the closest thing to it will be used.

You can also use the `'max'` flag to just use the maximum available resolution:

<Tabs
  groupId="component-style"
  defaultValue="hooks"
  values={[
    {label: 'Hooks API', value: 'hooks'},
    {label: 'Imperative API', value: 'imperative'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="hooks">

```ts
const device = ...
const format = useCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: 'max' },
  { photoResolution: 'max' }
])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="imperative">

```ts
const device = ...
const format = getCameraFormat(device, [
  { videoResolution: 'max' },
  { photoResolution: 'max' }
])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Camera Props

The `Camera` View provides a few props that depend on the specified `format`. For example, you can only set the `fps` prop to a value that is supported by the current `format`. So if you have a format that supports 240 FPS, you can set the `fps` to `240`:

```tsx
function App() {
  // ...
  const format = ...
  const fps = format.maxFps >= 240 ? 240 : format.maxFps

  return (
    <Camera
      style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
      device={device}
      format={format}
      fps={fps}
    />
  )
}
```

Other props that depend on the `format`:

* `fps`: Specifies the frame rate to use
* `hdr`: Enables HDR photo or video capture and preview
* `lowLightBoost`: Enables a night-mode/low-light-boost for photo or video capture and preview
* `videoStabilizationMode`: Specifies the video stabilization mode to use for the video pipeline
* `pixelFormat`: Specifies the pixel format to use for the video pipeline
