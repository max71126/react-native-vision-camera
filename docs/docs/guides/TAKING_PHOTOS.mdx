## Camera Functions

The Camera provides certain functions which are available through a [ref object](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html):

```tsx
function App() {
  const camera = useRef<Camera>(null)
  // ...

  return (
    <Camera
      ref={camera}
      {...cameraProps}
    />
  )
}
```

To use these functions, you need to wait until the [`onInitialized`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#oninitialized) event has been fired.

## Taking Photos

To take a photo you first have to enable photo capture:

```tsx
<Camera
  {...props}
  photo={true}
/>
```

Then, simply use the Camera's [`takePhoto(...)`](/docs/api/classes/Camera#takephoto) function:

```ts
const photo = await camera.current.takePhoto()
```

You can customize capture options such as [automatic red-eye reduction](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions#enableautoredeyereduction), [automatic image stabilization](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions#enableautostabilization), [enable flash](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions#flash), [prioritize speed over quality](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions#qualityprioritization), [disable the shutter sound](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions#enableshuttersound) and more using the [`TakePhotoOptions`](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions) parameter.

This function returns a [`PhotoFile`](/docs/api/interfaces/PhotoFile) which is stored in a temporary directory and can either be displayed using `<Image>` or `<FastImage>`, uploaded to a backend, or saved to the Camera Roll using [react-native-cameraroll](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll).

### Flash

The [`takePhoto(...)`](/docs/api/classes/Camera#takephoto) function can be configured to enable the [flash](/docs/api/interfaces/TakePhotoOptions#flash) automatically (when the scene is dark), always or never, which will only be used for this specific capture request:

```ts
const photo = await camera.current.takePhoto({
  flash: 'on' // 'auto' | 'off'
})
```

Note that flash is only available on camera devices where [`hasFlash`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice#hasflash) is `true`; for example most front cameras don't have a flash.

### Fast Capture

The [`takePhoto(...)`](/docs/api/classes/Camera#takephoto) function can be configured for faster capture at the cost of lower quality:

```ts
const photo = await camera.current.takePhoto({
  qualityPrioritization: 'speed',
  flash: 'off',
  enableShutterSound: false
})
```

## Saving the Photo to the Camera Roll

Since the Photo is stored as a temporary file, you need to save it to the Camera Roll to permanentely store it. You can use [react-native-cameraroll](https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll) for this:

```ts
const file = await camera.current.takePhoto()
await CameraRoll.save(`file://${file.path}`, {
  type: 'photo',
})
```

## Getting the Photo's data

To get the Photo's pixel data, you can use [`fetch(...)`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/network#using-fetch) to read the local file as a Blob:

```ts
const file = await camera.current.takePhoto()
const result = await fetch(`file://${file.path}`)
const data = await result.blob();
```
