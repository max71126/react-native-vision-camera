### What are frame processors?

Frame processors are functions that are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) which can be used to **process frames the camera "sees"**.
Inside those functions you can call **Frame Processor Plugins**, which are high performance native functions specifically designed for certain use-cases.

For example, you might want to create a [Hotdog/Not Hotdog detector app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-hotdog/id1212457521) **without writing any native code**, while still **achieving native performance**:

```jsx
function App() {
  const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
    'worklet'
    const isHotdog = detectIsHotdog(frame)
    console.log(isHotdog ? "Hotdog!" : "Not Hotdog.")
  }, [])

  return (
    <Camera
      {...cameraProps}
      frameProcessor={frameProcessor}
    />
  )
}
```

Frame processors are by far not limited to Hotdog detection, other examples include:

* **AI** for **facial recognition**
* **AI** for **object detection**
* Using **Tensorflow**, **MLKit Vision**, **Apple Vision** or other libraries
* Creating **realtime video-chats** using **WebRTC** to directly send the camera frames over the network
* Creating scanners for **QR codes**, **Barcodes** or even custom codes such as **Snapchat's SnapCodes** or **Apple's AppClips**
* Creating **snapchat-like filters**, e.g. draw a dog-mask filter over the user's face
* Creating **color filters** with depth-detection

Because they are written in JS, Frame Processors are **simple**, **powerful**, **extensible** and **easy to create** while still running at **native performance**. (Frame Processors can run up to **1000 times a second**!) Also, you can use **fast-refresh** to quickly see changes while developing or publish [over-the-air updates](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push) to tweak the Hotdog detector's sensitivity in live apps without pushing a native update.

:::note
Frame Processors require [**react-native-reanimated**](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) 2.2.0 or higher. Also make sure to add

```js
import 'react-native-reanimated'
```

to the top of the file when using `useFrameProcessor`.
:::

### Interacting with Frame Processors

Since Frame Processors run in [**Worklets**](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/worklets), you can directly use JS values such as React state:

```tsx
// can be controlled with a Slider
const [sensitivity, setSensitivity] = useState(0.4)

const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const isHotdog = detectIsHotdog(frame, sensitivity)
  console.log(isHotdog ? "Hotdog!" : "Not Hotdog.")
}, [sensitivity])
```

You can also easily read from, and assign to [**Shared Values**](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/shared-values) to create smooth, 60 FPS animations.

In this example, we detect a cat in the frame - if a cat was found, we assign the `catBounds` Shared Value to the coordinates of the cat (relative to the screen) which we can then use in a `useAnimatedStyle` hook to position the red rectangle surrounding the cat. This updates in realtime on the UI Thread, and can also be smoothly animated with `withSpring` or `withTiming`.

```tsx {6}
// represents position of the cat on the screen 🐈
const catBounds = useSharedValue({ top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 })

// continously sets 'catBounds' to the cat's coordinates on screen
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  catBounds.value = scanFrameForCat(frame)
}, [catBounds])

// uses 'catBounds' to position the red rectangle on screen.
// smoothly updates on UI thread whenever 'catBounds' is changed
const boxOverlayStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  position: 'absolute',
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'red',
  ...catBounds.value
}), [catBounds])

return (
  <View>
    <Camera {...cameraProps} frameProcessor={frameProcessor} />
    // draws a red rectangle on the screen which surrounds the cat
    <Reanimated.View style={boxOverlayStyle} />
  </View>
)
```

And you can also call back to the React-JS thread by using [`runOnJS`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/miscellaneous/runOnJS/):

```tsx {9}
const onQRCodeDetected = useCallback((qrCode: string) => {
  navigation.push("ProductPage", { productId: qrCode })
}, [])

const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const qrCodes = scanQRCodes(frame)
  if (qrCodes.length > 0) {
    runOnJS(onQRCodeDetected)(qrCodes[0])
  }
}, [onQRCodeDetected])
```

### Using Frame Processor Plugins

Frame Processor Plugins are distributed through npm. To install the [**vision-camera-image-labeler**](https://github.com/mrousavy/vision-camera-image-labeler) plugin, run:

```bash
npm i vision-camera-image-labeler
cd ios && pod install
```

Then add it to your `babel.config.js`. For the Image Labeler, this will be `__labelImage`:

```js {6}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      {
        globals: ['__labelImage'],
      },
    ],
```

:::note
You have to restart metro-bundler for changes in the `babel.config.js` file to take effect.
:::

That's it! 🎉 Now you can use it:

```ts
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const labels = labelImage(frame)
  // ...
}, [])
```

### Selecting a Format for a Frame Processor

When running frame processors, it is often important to choose an appropriate [format](/docs/guides/formats). Here are some general tips to consider:

* If you are running heavy AI/ML calculations in your frame processor, make sure to [select a format](/docs/guides/formats) that has a lower resolution to optimize it's performance.
* Sometimes a frame processor plugin only works with specific [pixel formats](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDeviceFormat#pixelformat). Some plugins (like MLKit) don't work with `x420`.

### Benchmarks

Frame Processors are _really_ fast. I have used [MLKit Vision Image Labeling](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/label-images) to label 4k Camera frames in realtime, and measured the following results:

* Fully natively (written in pure Objective-C, no React interaction at all), I have measured an average of **68ms** per call.
* As a Frame Processor Plugin (written in Objective-C, called through a JS Frame Processor function), I have measured an average of **69ms** per call.

This means that **the Frame Processor API only takes ~1ms longer than a fully native implementation**, making it **the fastest and easiest way to run any sort of Frame Processing in React Native**.

> All measurements are recorded on an iPhone 11 Pro, benchmarked total execution time of the [`captureOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideodataoutputsamplebufferdelegate/1385775-captureoutput) function by using [`CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1543542-cfabsolutetimegetcurrent). Running smaller images (lower than 4k resolution) is much quicker and many algorithms can even run at 60 FPS.

### Avoiding Frame-drops

Frame Processors will be **synchronously** called for each frame the Camera sees and have to finish executing before the next frame arrives, otherwise the next frame(s) will be dropped. For a frame rate of **30 FPS**, you have about **33ms** to finish processing frames. Use [`frameProcessorFps`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#frameprocessorfps) to throttle the frame processor's FPS. For a QR Code Scanner, **5 FPS** (200ms) might suffice, while a object tracking AI might run at the same frame rate as the Camera itself (e.g. **60 FPS** (16ms)).

### ESLint react-hooks plugin

If you are using the [react-hooks ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), make sure to add `useFrameProcessor` to `additionalHooks` inside your ESLint config. (See ["advanced configuration"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks#advanced-configuration))

### Technical

#### Frame Processors

**Frame Processors** are JS functions that will be **workletized** using [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated). They are created on a **parallel camera thread** using a separate JavaScript Runtime (_"VisionCamera JS-Runtime"_) and are **invoked synchronously** (using JSI) without ever going over the bridge. In a **Frame Processor** you can write normal JS code, call back to the React-JS Thread (e.g. `setState`), use [Shared Values](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/shared-values/) and call **Frame Processor Plugins**.

> See [**the example Frame Processor**](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/blob/cf68a4c6476d085ec48fc424a53a96962e0c33f9/example/src/CameraPage.tsx#L199-L203)

#### Frame Processor Plugins

**Frame Processor Plugins** are native functions (written in Objective-C, Swift, C++, Java or Kotlin) that are injected into the VisionCamera JS-Runtime. They can be **synchronously called** from your JS Frame Processors (using JSI) without ever going over the bridge. Because VisionCamera provides an easy-to-use plugin API, you can easily create a **Frame Processor Plugin** yourself. Some examples include [Barcode Scanning](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning), [Face Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection), [Image Labeling](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/image-labeling), [Text Recognition](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition) and more.

#### The `Frame` object

The Frame Processor gets called with a `Frame` object, which is a **JSI HostObject**. It holds a reference to the native (C++) Frame Image Buffer (~10 MB in size) and exposes properties such as `width`, `height`, `bytesPerRow` and more to JavaScript so you can synchronously access them. The `Frame` object can be passed around in JS, as well as returned from- and passed to a native **Frame Processor Plugin**.

### Disabling Frame Processors

The Frame Processor API spawns a secondary JavaScript Runtime which consumes a small amount of extra CPU and RAM. Additionally, compile time increases since Frame Processors are written in native C++. If you're not using Frame Processors at all, you can disable them:

<Tabs
  groupId="environment"
  defaultValue="rn"
  values={[
    {label: 'React Native', value: 'rn'},
    {label: 'Expo', value: 'expo'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="rn">

#### Android

Inside your `gradle.properties` file, add the `disableFrameProcessors` flag:

```
disableFrameProcessors=true
```

Then, clean and rebuild your project.

#### iOS

Inside your `project.pbxproj`, find the `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS` group and add the flag:

```txt {3}
GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS = (
  "DEBUG=1",
  "VISION_CAMERA_DISABLE_FRAME_PROCESSORS=1",
  "$(inherited)",
);
```

Make sure to add this to your Debug-, as well as your Release-configuration.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="expo">

Inside your Expo config (`app.json`, `app.config.json` or `app.config.js`), add the `disableFrameProcessors` flag to the `react-native-vision-camera` plugin:

```json
{
  "name": "my app",
  "plugins": [
    [
      "react-native-vision-camera",
      {
        // ...
        "disableFrameProcessors": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
