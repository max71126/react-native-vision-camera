### What are frame processors?

Frame processors are functions that are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) which can be used to **process frames the camera "sees"**.
Inside those functions you can call **Frame Processor Plugins**, which are high performance native functions specifically designed for certain use-cases.

For example, you might want to create a QR code scanner **without writing any native code**, while still **achieving native performance**:

```jsx
function App() {
  const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
    'worklet'
    const qrCodes = scanQRCodes(frame)
    console.log(`Detected QR Codes: ${qrCodes}`)
  }, [])

  return (
    <Camera
      {...cameraProps}
      frameProcessor={frameProcessor}
    />
  )
}
```

Frame processors are by far not limited to QR code detection, other examples include:

* **AI** for **facial recognition**
* **AI** for **object detection**
* Using **Tensorflow**, **MLKit Vision** or other libraries
* Creating **realtime video-chats** using **WebRTC** to directly send the camera frames over the network
* Creating scanners for QR codes, Barcodes or even custom codes such as Snapchat's SnapCodes or Apple's AppClips
* Creating **snapchat-like filters**, e.g. draw a dog-mask filter over the user's face
* Creating **color filters** with depth-detection

:::note
Frame Processors require [**react-native-reanimated**](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) 2.2.0 or higher.

### Interacting with Frame Processors

Since Frame Processors run in Worklets, you can also easily read from, and assign to [**Shared Values**](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/shared-values):

```tsx {6}
// represents position of the cat on the screen 🐈
const catBounds = useSharedValue({ top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 })

const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  catBounds.value = scanFrameForCat(frame)
}, [])

const boxOverlayStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  position: 'absolute',
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'red',
  ...catBounds.value
}), [catBounds])

return (
  <View>
    <Camera {...cameraProps} frameProcessor={frameProcessor} />
    // draws a red rectangle on the screen which surrounds the cat
    <Reanimated.View style={boxOverlayStyle} />
  </View>
)
```

And you can also call back to the React-JS thread using [`runOnJS`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/runOnJS):

```tsx {9}
const onQRCodeDetected = useCallback((qrCode: string) => {
  navigation.push("ProductPage", { productId: qrCode })
}, [])

const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const qrCodes = scanQRCodes(frame)
  if (qrCodes.length > 0) {
    runOnJS(onQRCodeDetected)(qrCodes[0])
  }
}, [onQRCodeDetected])
```

### Technical

* **Frame Processors** are JS functions that will be **workletized** using [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated). They are created on a **custom camera thread** using a separate JavaScript Runtime (_"VisionCamera JS-Runtime"_) and are **invoked synchronously** (using JSI) without ever going over the bridge.
* **Frame Processor Plugins** are native functions (written in Objective-C, Swift, C++, Java or Kotlin) that are injected into the VisionCamera JS-Runtime. They can be **synchronously called** from your JS Frame Processors (using JSI) without ever going over the bridge.

### Using Frame Processor Plugins

Frame Processor Plugins are distributed through npm. To install the [**vision-camera-qrcode-scanner**](https://github.com/mrousavy/vision-camera-qrcode-scanner) plugin, run:

```bash
npm i vision-camera-qrcode-scanner
cd ios && pod install
```

Then add it to your `babel.config.js`. For the QR Code Scanner, this will be `__scanQRCodes`:

```js {6}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      {
        globals: ['__scanQRCodes'],
      },
    ],
```

:::note
You have to restart metro-bundler for changes in the `babel.config.js` file to take effect.
:::

That's it! 🎉 Now you can use it:

```ts
const frameProcessor = useFrameProcessor((frame: Frame) => {
  'worklet'
  const codes = scanQRCodes(frame)
  // ...
}, [])
```

### Benchmarks

I have used [MLKit Vision Image Labeling](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/label-images) to label 4k Camera frames in realtime.

* Fully natively (written in pure Objective-C, no React interaction at all), I have measured an average of **68ms** per call.
* As a Frame Processor Plugin (written in Objective-C, called through a JS Frame Processor function), I have measured an average of **69ms** per call, meaning **the Frame Processor API only takes ~1ms longer than a fully native implementation**, making it **the fastest way to run any sort of Frame Processing in React Native**.

> All measurements are recorded on an iPhone 11 Pro, benchmarked total execution time of the [`captureOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideodataoutputsamplebufferdelegate/1385775-captureoutput) function by using [`CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1543542-cfabsolutetimegetcurrent). Running smaller images (lower than 4k resolution) is much quicker and many algorithms can even run at 60 FPS.

### ESLint react-hooks plugin

If you are using the [react-hooks ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), make sure to add `useFrameProcessor` to `additionalHooks` inside your ESLint config. (See ["advanced configuration"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks#advanced-configuration))

### Disabling Frame Processors

The Frame Processor API spawns a secondary JavaScript Runtime which consumes a small amount of extra CPU and RAM. If you're not using Frame Processors at all, you can disable them by setting the `VISION_CAMERA_DISABLE_FRAME_PROCESSORS` flag. Inside your `project.pbxproj`, find the `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS` parameter and add the flag:

```txt {3}
GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS = (
  "DEBUG=1",
  "VISION_CAMERA_DISABLE_FRAME_PROCESSORS=1",
  "$(inherited)",
);
```

Make sure to add this to your Debug-, as well as your Release-configuration.
