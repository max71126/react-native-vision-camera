## Committing

We love to keep our codebases clean. To achieve that, we use linters and formatters which output errors when something isn't formatted the way we like it to be.

Before pushing your changes, you can verify that everything is still correctly formatted by running all linters:

```
yarn check-all
```

This validates Swift, Kotlin, C++ and JS/TS code:

```bash
$ yarn check-all
   yarn run v1.22.10
   Formatting Swift code..
   Linting Swift code..
   Linting Kotlin code..
   Linting JS/TS code..
   All done!
   âœ¨  Done in 8.05s.
