### JS/TS

1. Open the entire folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Start the metro bundler in the `example/` directory using `yarn start`
3. Run either the iOS or Android project to test changes

> Run `yarn check-js` to validate codestyle

### iOS

1. Open the `example/ios/VisionCameraExample.xcworkspace` file with Xcode
2. Change signing configuration to your developer account
3. Select your device in the devices drop-down

## Committing

We love to keep our codebases clean. To achieve that, we use linters and formatters which output errors when something isn't formatted the way we like it to be.

Before pushing your changes, you can verify that everything is still correctly formatted by running all linters:

```
yarn check-all
```

This validates Swift, Kotlin, C++ and JS/TS code:

```bash
$ yarn check-all
   yarn run v1.22.10
   Formatting Swift code..
   Linting Swift code..
   Linting Kotlin code..
   Linting C++ code..
   Linting JS/TS code..
   All done!
   âœ¨  Done in 8.05s.
```
