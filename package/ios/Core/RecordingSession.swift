/**
 A [RecordingSession] class that can record video and audio [CMSampleBuffers] from [AVCaptureVideoDataOutput] and
 [AVCaptureAudioDataOutput] into a .mov/.mp4 file using [AVAssetWriter].

 It also synchronizes buffers to the CMTime by the CaptureSession so that late frames are removed from the beginning and added
 towards the end (useful e.g. for videoStabilization).
