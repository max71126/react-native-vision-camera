      description: >
        Share a small reproduceable code snippet here (or the entire file if necessary).
        Most importantly, share how you use the `<Camera>` component and what props you pass to it.
        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.

        Paste the JSON Camera `device` that was used here.
        Make sure to leave out the `formats` prop as that is too long for the issue.

        Run this code in your app to get the `device` as a JSON:

        ```

        console.log(JSON.stringify(device, (k, v) => k === "formats" ? [] : v, 2))

        ```

        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.
